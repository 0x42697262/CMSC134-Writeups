# Human Factors in Computer Security

<< DEFINE HUMAN FACTOR HERE or just add something the gives out details >>

## Identifying the Threat Actor

Identifying the threat actors[^1] to a certain individual or organization may pose a challenge, however it is easy to guess; it's **you**.

Okay, no, not literally you but the "user" itself. However, isn't the definition of a threat actor an external entity that poses a threat to an individual or organization? Well, yeah, but consider a situation where the user is guillible to the technology it poses. They do not understand the concept of keeping one's self safe from the internet (internet because they're more likely to face threats there than their local network).

The user figures that it is safe clicking on web URLs and downloading strange executables does not pose much as a threat. These actions introduces risks to the individual or organization. Hence the user is the threat to its self. The risks could be mitigated with proper training and decent knowledge.

The action that the user performed allowed "indiscriminate attacks" and these always happen on the wild, the internet. A notable destructive instance of such attacks is the WannaCry ransomware, which occurred on May 12, 2017[^2].

## Attack in Progress

```
do describe what happens here based on the security principles
- 2. Consider Human Factor
- 3. Security is economics

end conclusion should assume that the attack has failed. but what if the attack succeeds? proceed to next section
```

## You Have Been Pwned

```
*play all your base are belong to us* jk

maybe mention that cia triad has been broken
```

## suggestions/mitigations/etc

```
do these sections:
- 4. Detect if you can't prevent
- 5. Defense in depth
- 6. Least privilege
- 7. Separation of responsibility
- 8. Ensure complete mediation
- 9. Shannon's Maxim
- 10. Use fail-safe defaults
- 11. Design security from the start
- 12. Trusted Computing Base
- 13. TOCTTOU Vulnerabilities
```

## Conclusion

maybe? give a better title here.
